Hey! I am happy I got to give a few people a little help with this repo! However, I am sorry to say that I have completely moved out of web-tech development since then. I'll still be in Cesium but I won't be able to keep up with this. Feel free to fork/update this and let me know how it goes. It did work well when I used it last.

# cesium-electron-webpack
This is just the Cesium starter stuff injected into the electron-webpack-quickstart package using the the Cesium webpack tutorial (sort of). We're using it for a starting point and a coder's playground while begining a new Cesium based desktop app. It's nothing fancy but if your new-to/rusty-with Electron or Webpack or Electron-Webpack it might save you a little time.
