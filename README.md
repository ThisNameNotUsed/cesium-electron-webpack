# cesium-electron-webpack
This is just the Cesium starter stuff injected into the electron-webpack-quickstart package using the the Cesium webpack tutorial (sort of). We're using it for a starting point and a coder's playground while begining a new Cesium based desktop app. It's nothing fancy but if your new-to/rusty-with Electron or Webpack or Electron-Webpack it might save you a little time.
